            <h2>Hello from Tanya</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I’m Tanya Lundberg and I am running for Northville Township Trustee.</p>
            <p>
                My husband, Jeff, and I moved to Northville Township in 2009, just before our son was born. We wanted to
                find a place where we could plant roots, raise our son, and someday retire. When we walked into our
                house with our realtor, it was like a movie – we knew we had found our family’s home. We’ve enjoyed
                living here ever since and are invested in ensuring that Northville is a thriving place for all
                residents and visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an attorney and leader in the metro Detroit legal community, I’ve developed important skills that
                will make me an effective Township Trustee, including analytical, negotiation, problem-solving,
                research, and relationship-building skills. I’m running for the opportunity to put these skills to work
                for our community and be the voice that’s been missing from our Township Board.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my website and I hope I earn your vote.</p>

                <h3>Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    We must protect our community from environmental threats, such as Arbor Hills landfill. The landfill
                    impacts our health, our property values, and our overall quality of life. I will work with my Board
                    colleagues and the Conservancy Initiative, Ridge Wood parents, and government officials at the
                    county, state, and federal level to do everything we can to keep Arbor Hills in check and minimize
                    its impact on our community.

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Northville Twp. is attractive to residential and commercial developers, but we are running out of
                    space. I will work with my Board colleagues to ensure that we are thoughtful about continued
                    residential development and that we bring in commercial development that will enhance our community
                    and quality of life, as well as ensuring we include green space in our plans.

                <h3>Inclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Northville Twp. attracts diverse residents and visitors. We must be intentional about making sure
                    all of our residents and visitors feel welcomed and valued in our community. I will work to
                    cultivate deliberate inclusion at all levels of Township government, support unconscious bias
                    training for all Township employees, and implement community-based initiatives to support inclusion
                    in our neighborhoods.

            <h1>Hello from Tanya</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I’m Tanya Lundberg and I am running for Northville Township Trustee.</p>
            <p>
                My husband, Jeff, and I moved to Northville Township in 2009, just before our son was born. We wanted to
                find a place where we could plant roots, raise our son, and someday retire. When we walked into our
                house with our realtor, it was like a movie – we knew we had found our family’s home. We’ve enjoyed
                living here ever since and are invested in ensuring that Northville is a thriving place for all
                residents and visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an attorney and leader in the metro Detroit legal community, I’ve developed important skills that
                will make me an effective Township Trustee, including analytical, negotiation, problem-solving,
                research, and relationship-building skills. I’m running for the opportunity to put these skills to work
                for our community and be the voice that’s been missing from our Township Board.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my website and I hope I earn your vote.</p>
            <p>Tanya</p>

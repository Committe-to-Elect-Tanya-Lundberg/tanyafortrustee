            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Parent. Lawyer. Leader.</h2>
            <p>
                My mom raised my younger sister and me in Ferndale, a diverse and welcoming community in Oakland County.
                We didn’t have a lot, but my mom impressed upon us the importance of education, hard work, and dreaming
                big. I decided at a young age that I would be an attorney when I grew up. I earned a bachelor of arts
                degree in political science from the University of Michigan-Dearborn, where my husband Jeff and I met.
                At UM-D, I worked on the school newspaper, serving as the editor-in-chief for three semesters and
                earning a Distinguished Student Leader award. I then earned my juris doctor, cum laude, at Wayne State
                University Law School. At Wayne State, I served as an assistant editor on Law Review and was elected
                secretary of the Student Board of Governors (SBG), the law school’s student council. I earned the best
                assistant editor award on Law Review and the president’s award for outstanding contributions to SBG.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent almost nine years in private practice, first in commercial litigation, then in insurance
                defense. I joined the Women’s Bar Association (WBA), the Oakland Region of the Women Lawyers Association
                of Michigan (WLAM), and became active in the Oakland County Bar Association. I earned a WLAM Regional
                Leadership Award and served as WBA President (2018-2019). I currently serve as a Director at Large for
                WLAM.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2016, I transitioned to the Career Services Office at University of Detroit Mercy School of Law,
                where I am now the Assistant Dean. My team and I help Detroit Mercy Law students and alumni with their
                job search strategy, applications, practice interviews, and professional development. In addition to
                WLAM, I am active in the Federal Bar Association – Eastern District of Michigan Chapter and serve as the
                Vice Chair (Membership) of the Solo & Small CSO Section for the National Association for Law Placement.
                In 2017, I earned the Detroit Mercy Commitment to Excellence “Rising Star” award, based on my
                contributions to the Career Services Office and the School of Law. I am also a three-time finalist for
                Administrator of the Year, voted on by our law students.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I follow college football, men’s and women’s basketball, and softball (Go Blue!), read
                contemporary fiction (love my Kindle app), cook and bake, and walk for fitness. We enjoy playing card
                games (I am always looking for euchre tournaments) and I recently discovered the joys of planting
                annuals and kayaking. Jeff and I have been married for 14 years and he is my best friend and biggest
                supporter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I never back down from a challenge. I make decisions and work hard to see them through. I look for
                creative solutions to problems and accept and incorporate feedback from stakeholders. People who know me
                well describe me as reliable, determined, honest, and strong. I ran as a write-in candidate in the
                August primary because I am confident my skills and strengths will make me an asset to our Township
                government. Now that I’m on the November ballot, I am asking you to vote for me and give me a chance to
                make a difference for our community.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Northville Township</h2>
            <p>
                Jeff and I chose Northville Township based on its amenities, schools, and location, and we would choose it
                again in a heartbeat. We love putting our chairs out for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July parade, eating and
                shopping in downtown Northville, and supporting our son’s Stallions football team. Our son has attended
                Northville Public Schools since preschool and we have both volunteered in his classrooms and contributed
                to the PTA. We are close to our jobs and Ann Arbor, where we enjoy attending University of Michigan
                athletics events. </p>
                <p>
                    Northville Township is filled with great people and great opportunities.
